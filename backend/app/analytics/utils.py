# backend/app/analytics/utils.py
# This file is intended to serve as a centralized module for shared utility functions and helper
# methods used across the analytics engine. By consolidating common logic here, the application
# can avoid code duplication and improve maintainability. Examples of functions that might reside
# in this file include data normalization routines, custom formatting functions, or common
# mathematical computations that are not specific to any single analytical task. Currently, this
# file is a placeholder and can be populated as the need for shared utilities arises.
